/*
You are to build out a Random Name Generator.
Pulling in data from a local JSON file, you will create a designed Random Name Generator.
Have your application themed and make sure your list of names is the class plus the Instructors
No figma is required
You also need to have a section that shows the previous 5 names that were pulled from your Random Name Generator.
Don't forget to have fun!!!

// Peer Review: Darcy Rose - the font is kind of hard to read over the coding backgrounds, it might be a good idea to have the coding image as a full screen background and do a solid div with some opacity. That way you could still see the background but the text won't be so obscured. The code itself is solid though, well done.
