/*
You are to build out a Random Name Generator.
Pulling in data from a local JSON file, you will create a designed Random Name Generator.
Have your application themed and make sure your list of names is the class plus the Instructors
No figma is required
You also need to have a section that shows the previous 5 names that were pulled from your Random Name Generator.
Don't forget to have fun!!!

11/25/2025 - adjusted the background on the cards as well as for the whole body of the card, added missing .co emails

// Peer Review: Darcy Rose - the font is kind of hard to read over the coding backgrounds, it might be a good idea to have the coding image as a full screen background and do a solid div with some opacity. That way you could still see the background but the text won't be so obscured. The code itself is solid though, well done.

// Peer Review: Sammer Saqa - First of all project looks great. I noticed it works well overall but there are a few things I would adjust. Some of the student data has typos or missing emails that I would clean up, and the code fetches the JSON every time instead of just once, which I’d simplify by loading it once and reusing it. I also saw that the “previous student” cards are hard‑coded — meaning you manually wrote out five separate card sections in the HTML — and I’d prefer to generate those dynamically so the layout is more flexible. On top of that, they used <h1> tags everywhere which isn’t great for accessibility, and the dark overlay on the cards makes the text harder to read. Overall, the app is functional, but I’d make those changes to improve consistency, efficiency, and clarity. Great job!
